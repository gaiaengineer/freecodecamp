## 1 - Survey Form

### Project description

This is a simple survey form meant to collect data from users. By the design of the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/">Responsive Web Design</a> course, the learner should construct a survey form that is functionally similar to the example provided <a href="https://survey-form.freecodecamp.rocks">here</a>.

- If you enter numbers outside the range of the number input, which are defined by the <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> attributes, you will see an HTML5 validation error
- For the name, email, and number <code>input</code> fields, you can see corresponding label elements in the form, that describe the purpose of each field with the following ids: <code>id="name-label"</code>, <code>id="email-label"</code>, and <code>id="number-label"</code>

## 3 - Documentation Page

### Project description
This is a simple technical documentation page meant to give information on a certain syntax or functionality. By the design of the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/">Responsive Web Design</a> course, the learner should construct a technical documentation page that is functionally similar to the example provided <a href="https://technical-documentation-page.freecodecamp.rocks">here</a>. 
The following user stories should have been fulfilled: 
- You can see a <code>main</code> element with a corresponding <code>id="main-doc"</code>, which contains the page's main content (technical documentation)
- Within the <code>#main-doc</code> element, you can see several section elements, each with a class of <code>main-section</code>. There should be a minimum of five
- The first element within each <code>.main-section</code> should be a <code>header</code> element, which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
- Each section element with the class of <code>main-section</code> should also have an <code>id</code> that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding <code>id="JavaScript_and_Java"</code>)
