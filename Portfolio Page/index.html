            <a href="./project1.html"><h3 class="project-tile">Launching an In-House Support Tracker</h3></a>
            <ul>
              <li>Clear Business Vision: I defined precise business expectations and key metrics for the remote productivity tool. Technical requirements were meticulously crafted, envisioning the tool as a web service.</li>
              <li>Data Mastery: I compiled a comprehensive dataset from various sources, encompassing timeframes, incident details, employee skills, task complexities, functional software components, employee performance metrics, task statuses, and more.</li>
              <li>Design Excellence: I designed and created an interactive web service prototype that visually represented the entire support process. This interface enabled team leaders to dive deep into task details, such as task ownership, assignment volumes, status updates, and task complexities.</li>
              <li>Project Leadership: I expertly led an internal project team, including web developers, analysts, designers, and stakeholders, from conception through to the final implementation phase.</li>
            </ul>
            <a href="./project2.html"><h3>Transforming Chaos into Collaboration in the World of Online Fashion</h3></a>
            <ul>
              <li>Needs Assessment: I assessed the needs across various domains, including Delivery, Import & Export (ImpEx), Transport, Network, Call Center, Commercial, and partially Warehouse Management Systems (WMS). This information formed the foundation for a meticulously prioritized backlog, aligning requirements with business processes.</li>
              <li>Streamlined Product Development: I introduced a clear and streamlined product development process, spanning from idea pitching to implementation and review, grounded in robust business metrics.</li>
              <li>Data-Driven Decision Making: I instilled a conscious focus on the key business metric - "cost per delivery" - guiding future developments, feature additions, and defect corrections.</li>
              <li>Collaborative Stakeholder Engagement: Countless stakeholder and development team meetings were orchestrated, fostering a collaborative atmosphere for idea pitching and collective problem-solving.</li>
